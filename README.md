This is a semester project for my SDSU class CS577: Data Science taken in Spring 202 with Sean Kang. 

semester proj (1).pdf is the final report on the project. 
semester project.ipynb is the Python file all the code is in. 
Also included are all the datasets used in the project, in case they are no longer available through the official source.
